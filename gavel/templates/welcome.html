          Gavel is a judging platform that makes expo judging easier. Judges are asked to compare each project they review 
          against the previous project and make a simple decision on which of the two is better. By looking at your 
          comparison patterns as well as those of the other judges, Gavel determines rankings for all of the participating projects.
        </p>

        <p class="text-16 pb-1.6 md:pb-2.4">
          Gavel does not take into consideration any specific judging criteria set by event staff or the possible weighting of such 
          criteria in the evaluation of projects.
        </p>

        <p class="text-16 pb-1.6 md:pb-3.2">
          Please consult your eventâ€™s judging coordinator or equivalent staff member if you are unclear on how to use Gavel or have 
          any questions regarding judging criteria set by event staff.
